### Interests

What am I not interested in? I suspect it's the aneurotypical way that my brain is wired and filters information.

Interests, broadly speaking:
- Nature on Earth (inc. biology, geology), big things (cosmology), little things (physics)
- Thinking (inc. philosophy, religion, neurology, psychology, mathematics, epistemology, metaphysics, information science)
- Technology (too many to name, most branches, everything; I've helped design and build simple computers, websites, small data centres, networks, software, mobile apps, servers, websites, IOT, embedded systems, much much more)
- History (including archaeology, philology, etymology, genealogy, living history)
- Language (I'm learning a few languages, including modern Greek, and help people practice English, I watch more foreign movies and TV than English, including-but-not-limited-to: Mandarin, Korean, Hindi, German)
- Food (cooking and how not to burn water ðŸ¤£)
- Reading and writing... (music, stories, software, legal, much more)
- Everything else

### Quotes

> Where possible, focus on things that are worth knowing. - Andrew Kingdom

> Writer's Block? Think about things differently by: Somone new contacts the protagonist; add in random text from any source at hand; take time to relax, help a stranger, rewrite in a different format (e.g. as a screenplay) , put down the basics and move on. -- Andrew Kingdom

> Even experts know less than 1% of everything that can be known about life, the universe and everything.  â€” Andrew Kingdom

> Being an expert in one field does not guarantee expertise in another field. For example, understanding the science of combustion doesn't automatically make me good at cooking food on a fire. â€” Andrew Kingdom

> No book or other work is ever worth a divorce  â€” Andrew Kingdom

> You can't truly love others if you're not caring for yourself. It's like how airlines say, 'Put on your own mask first, then help others.'  â€” Andrew Kingdom

> A.I. is a useful artificial tool made humans to help human; don't confuse it with actual intelligence, the two are not the same and never will be. â€” Andrew Kingdom
