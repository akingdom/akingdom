### Quotes

> Where possible, focus on things that are worthwhile. - Andrew Kingdom

> Writer's Block? Think about things differently by: Adding a new communication; add in random text from any source at hand; take time to relax, help a stranger, rewrite in a different format (e.g. story as a screenplay), don't get bogged down, put down the basics and move on. -- Andrew Kingdom

> Even experts know less than 1% of everything that can be known about life, the universe and everything.  â€” Andrew Kingdom

> Being an expert in one field does not guarantee expertise in another field. For example, understanding the science of combustion doesn't automatically make me good at cooking food on a fire. â€” Andrew Kingdom

> No book or other work is ever worth a divorce  â€” Andrew Kingdom

> You can't truly love others if you're not caring for yourself. It's like how airlines say, 'Put on your own mask first, then help others.'  â€” Andrew Kingdom

> A.I. is a useful artificial tool made humans to help human; don't confuse it with actual intelligence, the two are not the same and never will be. â€” Andrew Kingdom
